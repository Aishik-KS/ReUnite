# ReUnite â€“ AI-Powered Lost & Found Platform for NTU

##  Inspiration
The current NTU lost & found system relies on:
- A cluttered Telegram channel (hard to search through long messages)
- A physical Google Sheets at One-Stop SAC (inconvenient for reporting)

We built ReUnite to modernize this process with AI and cloud technology.

##  Tech Stack

| Component           | Technology                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**        | React.js + Vite                    |
| **Backend**         | Firebase Cloud Firestore  + NodeJs         |
| **Authentication**  | Firebase Auth                      |
| **AI Services**     | Gemini (for image analysis)        |
| **Maps**            | Google Maps API                    |
| **Media Storage**   | Cloudinary                         |
